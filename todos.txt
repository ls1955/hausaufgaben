feature
- safe mode that hides all the folder besides non-naughty folder

tasks
- include a reset storage permission
- include delete button when viewing image

improvements
- support playing .mp4 (might have to roll out own package)
- moving files one by one is quite slow

refactor
- In utils.js, there is a lot of hardcoding, particularly in organizeDownloadFolder and getNewFolderPath,
  making the code fragile and hard to reason about. Besides that, the logic flow when dealing with
  organizing folder sucks. Unfortunately, current version of author is not smart enough to get himself
  out of this mess.
- Styles. There are a lots of hardcoded value on style, which make it unresponsive to different device dimension.

todo:
- style OrganizeDownloadModal
- append new folder and album into context after organizeDownloadFolder
- the header will move around when flatlist in homescreen is not ready

fix
- timing of show flash message after finish organize download folder seems off

todo
- include a navbar, like so:
  | toggle_safe_mode(eyeball? Ionicons from package) | organize | more_options(triple dot) |
