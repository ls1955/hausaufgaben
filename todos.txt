feature
- safe mode that hides all the folder besides non-naughty folder

tasks
- include album thumbnails (one way or another...)
- include folder thumbnail (use the first picture)
- have a scrollbar that allow user to scroll through stuffs via percentage
- include a reset storage permission
- show a flash message when done moving file
- include delete button when viewing image

improvements
- eager load folder images when clicked on an album?
- merge commit modal in HomeScreen into navigation header
- support playing .mp4

refactor
- In utils.js, there is a lot of hardcoding, particularly in organizeDownloadFolder and getNewFolderPath,
  making the code fragile and hard to reason about. Besides that, the logic flow when dealing with
  organizing folder sucks. Unfortunately, current version of author is not smart enough to get himself
  out of this mess.

todo:
- style OrganizeDownloadModal
- append new folder and album into context after organizeDownloadFolder
- include flash message for modal notification

fix
- when to_staging_area is checked, the content are moved to staging_area/undefined
- include indication when content is being move
- sort doujin/vanilla numerically instead of aphabetically

function
- sanitize folder input beforehand (lookup illegal character in Android file system)
- rename format function to something like shorten?
