feature
- safe mode that hides all the folder besides non-naughty folder

tasks
- include a reset storage permission
- include delete button when viewing image

improvements
- support playing .mp4 (might have to roll out own package)
- moving files one by one is quite slow (use native module)?

refactor
- In utils.js, there is a lot of hardcoding, particularly in organizeDownloadFolder and getNewFolderPath,
  making the code fragile and hard to reason about. Besides that, the logic flow when dealing with
  organizing folder sucks. Unfortunately, current version of author is not smart enough to get himself
  out of this mess.
- Styles. There are a lots of hardcoded value on style, which make it unresponsive to different device dimension.

todo:
- update folder and album accordingly after organizeDownloadFolder

fix
- the header will move around when flatlist in homescreen is not ready
- timing of show flash message after finish organize download folder seems off

todo
- include a navbar, like so:
  | toggle_safe_mode(eyeball? Ionicons from package) | organize | more_options(triple dot) |
- rewrite library-like code with TypeScript?
