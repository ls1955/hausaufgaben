feature
- safe mode that hides all the folder besides non-naughty folder

tasks
- include album thumbnails (one way or another...)
- include folder thumbnail (use the first picture)
- include a reset storage permission
- include delete button when viewing image

improvements
- eager load folder images when clicked on an album? (current performance is good enough)
- support playing .mp4 (might have to roll out own package)

refactor
- In utils.js, there is a lot of hardcoding, particularly in organizeDownloadFolder and getNewFolderPath,
  making the code fragile and hard to reason about. Besides that, the logic flow when dealing with
  organizing folder sucks. Unfortunately, current version of author is not smart enough to get himself
  out of this mess.
- Styles. There are a lots of hardcoded value on style, which make it unresponsive to different device dimension.
- Shows a flash message when done moving file (timing of showing seems late in production)

todo:
- style OrganizeDownloadModal
- append new folder and album into context after organizeDownloadFolder
- the header will move around when flatlist in homescreen is not ready
- set default album and folder cover style

fix
- sort doujin/vanilla numerically instead of aphabetically
- improve abbreviate function, when there are chinese character, every character take more space than alphabet
- include a sortHashByKeyAlphabetically and sortHashByKeyNumerically util function?
