improvements

fix
- when sorting doujin, should sort by their number instead of alphabetically

refactor
- In utils.js, there is a lot of hardcoding, particularly in organizeDownloadFolder and getNewFolderPath,
  making the code fragile and hard to reason about. Besides that, the logic flow when dealing with
  organizing folder sucks. Unfortunately, current version of author is not smart enough to get himself
  out of this mess.
