feature
- safe mode that hides all the folder besides non-naughty folder
  - do we really need that feature? Might be nice to have.

tasks
- include a reset storage permission
- include delete button when viewing image
  - modify existing image-viewing library to include onSingleTouch callback?
  - include delete file function and update state accordingly...

improvements
- support playing .mp4 (might have to roll out own package)
- moving files one by one is quite slow (use native module)?

refactor
- In utils.js, there is a lot of hardcoding, particularly in organizeDownloadFolder and getNewFolderPath,
  making the code fragile and hard to reason about. Besides that, the logic flow when dealing with
  organizing folder sucks. Unfortunately, current version of author is not smart enough to get himself
  out of this mess.
- Styles. There are a lots of hardcoded value on style, which make it unresponsive to different device dimension.

fix
- the header will move around when flatlist in homescreen is not ready
- avoid mutating folders and albums context

todo
- include a navbar, like so:
  | toggle_safe_mode(eyeball? Ionicons from package) | organize | more_options(triple dot) |
- rewrite library-like code with TypeScript?

thoughts
- When downloading new stuff, any simple way to let the app know there are new file?
  - The data themselves won't change, and try to update the album in interval... didn't sounds right
  - There are probably something that author missed...
- After organized the file, we could simply update data inside Album and Folder context...
